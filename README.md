This library is designed to assist in the use of common Machine Learning Algorithms in conjunction with the .NET platform. It is designed to include the most popular supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms while minimizing the friction involved with creating the predictive models.

# Contributing
I would love to take contributions! Please read [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/). The key is cloning from the dev branch (and not the master branch) and then creating a new branch for your edits. The master branch is hooked up to an automatic build process which fires off on every commit.
